Digtial Hurdy Gurdy prototypes

Current prototype using Bela, pure data, UsbKeyboard as isomorphic keyboard, VHS tape head reader with Reflectance sensor, Trill Flex, knobs and switches.

Version numbers should go:
Prototype Hardware Setup:
0.0.n - pure data only patches, running on Bela with sensors and inputs.
0.1.n - Pure data with faust, testing on Bela with sensors and inputs.

Let's see what happens after that...
